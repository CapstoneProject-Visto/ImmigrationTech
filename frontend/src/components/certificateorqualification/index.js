          7) Do you have a certificate of qualification from a Canadian

        <p>
          Note: A certificate of qualification lets people work in some skilled
          trades in Canada. Only the provinces, territories and a federal body
          can issue these certificates. To get one, a person must have them
          assess their training, trade experience and skills to and then pass a
          certification exam.
          <br />
          People usually have to go to the province or territory to be assessed.
          They may also need experience and training from an employer in Canada.{" "}
          <br />
          This isnâ€™t the same as a nomination from a province or territory.
